Winter's Development Branch

For: -Importing, editing, and exporting animations. (Create placeholder anims in vsmc first rather than making them in blender.) -Modeling (importing, editing, exporting.)

Notes: If you import your model with animations, set it back to rest post. (Letting it import with an anim frame solidified import/export drama.)

While I plan to add UV mirroring, easy stacking, unwrapping, right now the UV actions are not considered functional- use the main branch's version if you plan to UV in blender. It cannot export anims, but it can export models without distortion. (Ey, I fixed that!)
