Winter's Development Branch

-Slowly making a "new" blender tool, reflavored from main branch.-
+Adds mirror button which duplicates, auto renames L or Left to R or Right, and flips geometry/bones in relation to cursor (so put it on world origin.)
+Assigns 'skin' material and removes all other mats (so no 'null')
+Renames mesh data to match object data so no hidden decimals in json (on import and export- decimals are not good for a json m'kay.)
+Supports animation import/export without fuss.
+Adds a new UV unwrap mode "View to Bounds" which captures all 6 cuboid directions and speeds up UV layouts.

HIGHLY EXPERIMENTAL
